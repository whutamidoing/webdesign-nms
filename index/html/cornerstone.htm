                The Importance of Nitrogen
                </h2>
                <p class="introduction">
                Because a fruit tree is a sessile organism (it cannot move),
                it depends upon its owner to properly feed it.  Nitrogen
                is an essential nutrient for the production of amino acids,
                proteins, nucleic acids, etc., and stone fruit trees require
                an adequate annual supply for proper growth and productivity.
                Nitrogen is primarily absorbed through fine roots as either 
                ammonium or nitrate.  This uptake can be affected by soil
                type, pH, temperature, soil moisture content, and time of year.  
                For bearing trees, the goal of the producer should be to
                achieve a proper balance through fertilization so that adequate 
                leaf and tree growth occur without compromising fruit production 
                and quality. Another goal should be to maintain a healthy leaf 
                canopy well past harvest so that nitrogen in the leaves can be 
                remobilized back into the tree before defoliation for storage 
                as reserves that later support bloom and initial canopy development 
                the following spring.  These reserves are tapped before root uptake 
                of soil nitrogen begins.

                The Right Amount
            </h3>
    
            <p class="supporting-details_body">
                Insufficient nitrogen reserves from the previous fall 
                hinder spring canopy development.  If this persists 
                during the growing season, leaf and shoot growth is 
                stunted and yield will be reduced.  Premature defoliation 
                may occur in the fall.  Symptomatic leaves may appear 
                chlorotic (yellowish) with a reddish coloration while 
                twigs will be stunted and appear spindly with a red-colored 
                bark.  Fruits may have good red coloration but will typically 
                be small and may have poor flavor. Excess nitrogen 
                can result in a shoot canopy that is much larger and 
                denser than necessary.  Too much foliage affects the 
                penetration of sunlight, the humidity of air within 
                the canopy, and the penetration of foliar-applied 
                pesticides.  Negative consequences include increased 
                disease pressure, and reduced size and coloration of 
                fruits that may be delayed in ripening.  Inadequate 
                sunlight penetration into the inner, lower portions of 
                the canopy may hamper flower bud initiation that could 
                adversely affect next year's crop. Generally speaking, 
                using too much nitrogen is a waste of money!  
                In addition to the negative points already noted, excess
                vegetative growth increases labor costs for pruning . 
                Excess nitrogen that is not taken up by the tree can lead 
                to environmental pollution by runoff or leaching into the 
                groundwater.

                Research Developments
            </h3>
    
            <p class="conclusion_body">
                Research has demonstrated that a single-dose, spring 
                application of a high rate of nitrogen may be very 
                inefficient.  This may be due, in part, to the fact that 
                tree demand for nitrogen from the soil is actually low at 
                this time because most nitrogen is being remobilized from 
                reserves within the tree itself. Heavy spring rains may 
                leach much of the nitrogen from the zone of the soil where 
                the absorptive feeder roots live and cool soil temperatures 
                may limit root uptake. Research has indicated that annual 
                nitrogen rates can be reduced by as much as 50% without 
                detrimental effects on tree growth and productivity.  
                The key to achieving improved nitrogen use efficiency is 
                applying smaller amounts of nitrogen several times during 
                the growing season when active growth and absorption by 
                roots is occurring.  This can be accomplished either by 
                broadcast application of granular fertilizer to the 
                ground or even more efficiently through low-pressure 
                microirrigation systems where water-soluble nitrogen 
                forms are used (fertigation). The real question is when 
                to make these applications.  In ongoing research at 
                Clemson University in my peach systems trial project, I am 
                collaborating with Clemson root physiologist, Dr. Christina 
                Wells.  We have installed 72 minirhizotrons (underground root 
                observation tubes) to monitor peach root growth throughout the 
                season.  We hope to time fertilizer applications with the periods 
                of root “flushing” and to correlate this with above-ground 
                phenological growth stages (i.e., full bloom, shuck split, 
                pit hardening, final swell, postharvest, etc.).  The long-term 
                goal is to be able to precisely time fertilizer applications 
                with the period when fertilizer is most needed by the tree.
                Finally, research in California and Italy has indicated that 
                postharvest nitrogen fertilization using foliar applications 
                of urea in the fall provides a good supplement to build tree 
                reserves with minimal detrimental environmental impact.  
                This would not be suitable in colder Northern climates because 
                it could delay hardening off and result in winter injury.
