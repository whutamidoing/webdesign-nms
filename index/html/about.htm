					<h2>About my Website</h2>
					<p>
						Welcome to my Website, 
						a project for my Empowerment Technology subject, 
						I chose to design around <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/">No Man's Sky</a>,
						a game on Steam for its sci-fi and scientific genre also because I enjoyed it for its planetary exploration.
					</p>
					<h2>About this game</h2>
					
					<p>
						Inspired by the adventure and imagination that we love from classic science-fiction, 
						No Man's Sky presents you with a galaxy to explore, 
						filled with unique planets and lifeforms, and constant danger and action.
					</p>
					<p>
						In No Man's Sky, 
						every star is the light of a distant sun, 
						each orbited by planets filled with life, 
						and you can go to any of them you choose. 
						Fly smoothly from deep space to planetary surfaces, 
						with no loading screens, and no limits. 
						In this infinite procedurally generated universe, 
						you'll discover places and creatures that no other players have seen before 
						- and perhaps never will again.
					</p>
					<h3>
						Now including...
					</h3>
					<p>
						Play with all major updates since launch: 
						Foundation, Pathfinder, Atlas Rises, NEXT, The Abyss, Visions, the 2.0 BEYOND update, Synthesis, Living Ship, Exo Mech, Desolation and the 3.0 update, ORIGINS, Next Generation, Companions, Expeditions, Prisms, Frontiers, Sentinel, Outlaws, Endurance, Waypoint (4.0), Fractal, Interceptor and Echoes.
					</p>
					<p>
						An epic voyage to the centre of a shared universe awaits, allowing you to explore, trade, fight and survive alone or with friends.
